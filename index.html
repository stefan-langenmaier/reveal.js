					<h1>Docker</h1>
					<h3>and its (composability) issues</h3>
					<p>
						<small>Created by <a href="https://github.com/stefan-langenmaier">Stefan Langenmaier</a></small>
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						I want to talk about some specific problems that I exists in my opinion specifically for the Docker system
						
						I won't talk about all the known problems, but I will give some sources :)
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is docker</h2>
					<p>
						The company behind docker : Docker, Inc.
						dockerhub
						dockerfiles
						container
						images
						docker architecture (and api)
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						To clarify the vocabulary let's talk about some terms
						
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Virtualisation vs Containerisation</h2>
					<p>
						What is the difference?
						
						Running a different kernel with maybe a different configuration? Wider or narrower: my SYSVIPC problem for exemple with full disk-encryption LUKS and apache
						
						might be better to isolate different images together with their kernels to have _more_ reproduciable containers
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Full virtualised systems all run on their on kernels. Moderen hardware has support for it.
						Paravirtualised systems run on their on kernel, but the kernel knows its running virtualised and is optimized for that.
						
						Containerized systems run all on the same kernel. So this kernel has a global ressource control and can do a global optimzation of the resources.
						Possibly big performance gains now and in the future. Competing environments can "talk" to each other.
						
						So generally a good idea to use containers? Well it depends, as you exclude your kernel from the image your behaviour can change in the future when you update your kernel or when you change your distribution.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Containerization differences/alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						What are the differences?
						Why do they exist?

						OpenVZ
						Linux VServer
						they are only available via patches not part of the official kernel
						
						docker
						lxd
						lxc
						lmctfy
						rocket
						systemd-nsspawn
						they are all based on cgroups, which is in the vanilla kernel. so easy upgrades in the future very important point, as all your containers depend on that kernel
						
						jails
						zones
						similair things for other oses
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Known problems of Docker</h2>
					<p>
						check out the links at the end
						
						different people say different things
						be it the network is not properly implemented
						be it the whole infrastructure is not secure (no signed images)
						
						you can have a look into the links at the end
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The problem I want to talk about here</h2>
					<p>
						Experimenting with a container - developpment and especially testing
						=> Changing components on multiple levels
						
						and then create a minimal production container at the end
						
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Example problem</h2>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<th>
								<td></td>
								<td>Webserver</td>
								<td>Interface</td>
								<td>Ruby</td>
								<td>DB</td>
								<td>Redmine</td>
								<td>Sum</td>							
							</th>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Combinations</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>2</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>2</td>
								<td>5</td>
								<td>180</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Combinations - Docker (*)</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>6</td>
								<td>18</td>
								<td>36</td>
								<td>180</td>
								<td>180+36=216</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Combinations - Composable (+)</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>5</td>
								<td>8</td>
								<td>10</td>
								<td>15</td>
								<td>180+15=195</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>
						Curse of dimensions
						
						the non-composable build system has about 10% more combinations
						
						this does not seem much but with more components/levels this is increasing exponentially
						
						especially sad because the matrix will only be sparsely populated
					</p>

					<h2>Let's visualize it</h2>
					<div id="stackednetwork" style="height: 100%; width=100%;"></div>
                    
				</section>
				
				

				<section>
					<h2>You can ignore this problem</h2>
					<p>
						if you like monocultures
						if you like vendor-lockin
						
						but if you like variety in your experimenting and really minimal systems in production you're screwed
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Half-Solutions</h2>
					<p>
						use squash in between if you have found a good base
						
						but the problem is there is no undo you can not revert a previous commit and change it
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Half-Solutions</h2>
					<p>
						use packer a tool to build images without Dockerfiles
						
						honestly I don't get it, this sounds even worse as it has even less features than the already feature deprived Dockerfiles
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Solutions to this are good package managers</h2>
					<p>
						they are around for a while and alreay pretty stable
						
						if your package manager really cannot do there is still bash available
						this is basically what a Dockerfile is doing but without obstructing you
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Example - Gentoo</h2>
					<p>
						creating a minimal Redmine installation
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Thanks - My Q/A</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What are the alternatives?</li>
						<li>What is the good what can we keep?</li>
						<li>Are these temporary issues or will there be a vendor-lockin?</li>
					</ul>
