					<h1>Gentoo</h1>
					<h3>What's different</h3>
					<h3>What's Gentoo</h3>
					<p>
						Gentoo is a source-based, rolling-release meta-distribution! :)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Terms and tools</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><em>portage</em>, repository of packages or so called ebuilds, complete copy locally</li>
						<li><em>ebuild</em> is a recipe how to create a package from the source files and how to install</li>
						<li><em>emerge</em> is a tool that executes theses ebuilds and does depdency resolution, depdency resolution is really tough in gentoo</li>
						<li><em>eselect</em> profiles and alternatives</li>
						<li>eread</li>
						<li>etc-update</li>
						<li>genkernel</li>
						<li>eix</li>
						<li>gentoolkit</li>
						<li>revdep-rebuild</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>So what features do we get?</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Necessary tools, helping tools, third party tools
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>

					<h2>Only one version</h2>
					<p>
	* no re-installs, just has to installed once
	* bleeding edge falls back into stable (later we get to that)
	* not really true, stable, unstable, masked, slots, but there is only one current Gentoo
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Never do a dist-upgrade, look a the website www.gentoo.org that's because you will only visit that page once.
					</aside>
	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Customizable</h2>
				    <h3>/etc/portage/make.conf</h3> 
					<p>
						(RICERS!) (Gentoo is for ricers)
					</p>

					<h3>use flags</h3>
					<p>
						The true power of gentoo
					</p>

					<h3>/etc/portage/package.*</h3>
					<p>
						I want more configuration options! You can have it. Even down to the license.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Flexibilty</h2>
					<p>
    slots
        exemple java
        exemple python
        exemple mysql
		exemple php
    virtuals
        exemple java
        exemple python
    supported architectures
		arm
		x86

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						But your dev environment has a lot of different requirements?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Maintenance</h2>
					<p>
						eselect profiles
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						How can I cope with all these options?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Choice</h2>
					<p>
    systemd vs openrc
    	maybe even surpasses debian
    kernel (linux default, but also bsd, mac and windows)
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						You're greedy and you want even more?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Development</h2>

		live ebuild
		    EGIT variable
		hooks (for patching certain packages)
		cross-compiling (crossdev)

					<aside class="notes">
						But in your development, you don't need all that funky stuff?
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Strength</h2>
					
    package manager, most complex resolution, most effective finds errors
    documentation
        only surpassed by ubuntu (quantity)
        arch (quantity, quality)

					<aside class="notes">
						Conclusion, especially crazy setups have already be done in Gentoo.
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Weakness</h2>
					

    speed of installation
    there is no automated installer
    there is no gui for the package manager

can be solved with

    funtoo
    sabayon


					<aside class="notes">
						Porque no los dos?
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Rumors</h2>
					<p>

    unstable (maybe during compilation as the build combination may have never been tried and less testing than a distro like fedore or ubuntu)
        working close with upstream
        vanilla, almost no patches (like arch)
        less code linked (use flags) means less code for errors
    speed, no gentoo is not faster as the advantage is neglibile
        but the system maybe has less shit installed (ubuntu, fedora, mandriva, suse)

					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Historical problems</h2>
					<p>

    Daniel Robbins (left the project for Microsoft, this caused a little bit of chaos)
        is back, is the head of funtoo, I had the feeling he was not to well greeted back in the gentoo community, by some of the former devs
    gentoo foundation/council/trustees (In that chaos they forgot to renew/register Gentoo as non profit, some people thought Gentoo would die, this was in 2007?, it is still felt to this day)
        some say the gentoo organization is over-engineered now
    git (portage is held in a cvs repo!, this was supposed to change in 2009?, still hasn't happened)
        development is nowadays happening in overlays, almost all overlays are on moderns dvcs, and are agnostics of this, only the main repo is still on cvs and they seem to still struggle put all the quality control infrastructure to git

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						This is all hearsay from me, don't trust this exactly!
					</aside>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Examples</h2>
					<p>
	slots with php
		emerge php:4 =php-5.5.2-r2 -av
    virtual with license
		emerge jdk
    git live ebuild
    custom patch

					</p>
