					<h1>Docker</h1>
					<h3>and its (composability) issues</h3>
					<p>
						<small>Created by <a href="https://github.com/stefan-langenmaier">Stefan Langenmaier</a></small>
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						I want to talk about some specific problems that exists in my opinion specifically for the Docker system
						
						I won't talk about all the known problems, but I will give some sources :)
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is docker</h2>
					<p>
						good question?
						
						it's a company,
						a tool to manage (create, run, deploy, delete) containers and images on different platforms (linux, mac, win),
						a host for these images (where you can have an account, think app store)
						a library to interface the linux kernel container infrastructure
						
						it's a lot of different things (one of the reasons a "competitor" started it's own library rkt)
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						To clarify the vocabulary let's talk about some terms
						
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Virtualisation vs Containerisation</h2>
					<p>
						What is the difference?
						
						Running a different kernel with maybe a different configuration? Wider or narrower: my SYSVIPC problem for exemple with full disk-encryption LUKS and apache
						
						might be better to isolate different images together with their kernels to have _more_ reproduciable containers
					</p>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Full virtualised systems all run on their on kernels. Moderen hardware has support for it.
						Paravirtualised systems run on their on kernel, but the kernel knows its running virtualised and is optimized for that.
						
						Containerized systems run all on the same kernel. So this kernel has a global ressource control and can do a global optimzation of the resources.
						Possibly big performance gains now and in the future. Competing environments can "talk" to each other.
						
						So generally a good idea to use containers? Well it depends, as you exclude your kernel from the image your behaviour can change in the future when you update your kernel or when you change your distribution. The promise of reproduceable is overrated.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Containerization differences/alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						What are the differences?
						Why do they exist?

						uml
						OpenVZ
						Linux VServer
						they are only available via patches not part of the official kernel
						
						docker
						lxd
						lxc
						lmctfy
						rocket
						systemd-nsspawn
						they are all based on cgroups, which is in the vanilla kernel. so easy upgrades in the future very important point, as all your containers depend on that kernel
						
						jails
						zones
						similair things for other oses
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Known problems of Docker</h2>
					<p>
						check out the links at the end
						
						different people say different things
						be it the network is not properly implemented
						be it the whole infrastructure is not secure (no signed images)
						
						you can have a look into the links at the end
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The problem I want to talk about here</h2>
					<p>
						Experimenting with a container - developpment and especially testing
						=> Changing components on multiple levels
						
						and then create a minimal production container at the end
						
						These are two different task but they are normally related to each other
						
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Example problem</h2>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<th>
								<td></td>
								<td>Webserver</td>
								<td>Interface</td>
								<td>Ruby</td>
								<td>DB</td>
								<td>Redmine</td>
								<td>Sum</td>							
							</th>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Combinations</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>2</td>
								<td>3</td>

							<tr>
								<td>Combinations - Docker (*)</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>6</td>
								<td>18</td>
								<td>36</td>
								<td>180</td>
								<td>180+36=216</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Combinations - Composable (+)</td>
								<td>3</td>
								<td>5</td>
								<td>8</td>
								<td>10</td>
								<td>15</td>
								<td>180+15=195</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>
						Curse of dimensions
						
						the non-composable build system has about 10% more combinations
						
						this is NOT the problem, they will always be of the same magnitude
						
						the problem is between the 15 and the 36
						with 15 packages prepared you can create any combination you want
						with 36 base images prepared you can create any last image you want, you still have to create it manually and adapted to each though
						
						it is sad because the matrix will only be sparsely populated
						
						we will NEVER try all possible combinations only the ones that seem interesting and this is not always known in advance
						
						but if the work to change/experiment/try is to high we are in a kind of vendor lock-in, the base where you are starting from decides on your tools
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Let's visualize it (stacked)</h2>
					<div id="stackednetwork" style="height: 50vh; width: 100%;"></div>
					
					<p>
					Now imagine you want to change a lower level package/setting
					then you have to recreate all images, that are based on this one.

				<section>
					<h2>Let's visualize it (composed)</h2>
					<div id="composednetwork" style="height: 50vh; width: 100%;"></div>
                    
				</section>
				
				

				<section>
					<h2>You can ignore this problem</h2>
					<p>
						if you like monocultures
						if you like vendor-lockin
						
						but if you like variety in your experimenting and really minimal systems in production you're screwed
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Half-Solutions</h2>
					<p>
						use squash in between if you have found a good base
						
						but the problem is there is no undo you can not revert a previous commit and change it
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Half-Solutions</h2>
					<p>
						use packer a tool to build images without Dockerfiles
						
						honestly I don't get it, this sounds even worse as it has even less features than the already feature deprived Dockerfiles
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Solutions to this are good package managers</h2>
					<p>
						they are around for a while and alreay pretty stable
						
						if your package manager really cannot do there is still bash available
						this is basically what a Dockerfile is doing but without obstructing you
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Example - Gentoo</h2>
					<p>
						creating a minimal Redmine installation
						
						this uses just lxc
						two containers, both are running Gentoo but the host can be whatever distribution you like
						
						one container runs the package manager
						the second one is not even a real Gentoo as there is not even a package manager installed in the end
						
						both a running openrc as init system (this could be changed to systemd or even none)
						the passenger people recommend to run it with an init system, but they are using something strange called my_init
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Base Installation</h2>
					<p>
						container init
						
						with template stuff
						
						lxc-create -n redmine-runtime -t gentoo-runtime -- --template /home/stefan/git/lxc-gentoo-build-tools/redmine-runtime-template
						
						nano config
						
						emerge baselayout -av
						
						emerge openrc shadow util-linux bash coreutils -av
						
						emerge grep net-tools procps findutils dhcpcd nano sed -av
						
						ln -s net.eth0 net.lo
						rc-update add net.eth0 default
						
						
						
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Redmine Installation</h2>
					<p>
						live package
						
						emerge redmine -av
						
						configuration
						
						cd /build/lxc/redmine-runtime/rootfs//var/lib/redmine
						cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
						${EDITOR} config/database.yml
						chown 1000:1000 config/database.yml
						emerge --config "=www-apps/redmine-9999"
						 
						chown 1000:1000 db/ db/*.sqlite3
						groupadd apache
						useradd -g apache apache

						/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Installation cleanup</h2>
					<p>
						to reduce the size
						
						emerge gcc portage perl python glibc -C -av
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Change of webserver</h2>
					<p>
						install nginx
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Thanks - My Q/A</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What are the alternatives?</li>
						<li>What is the good what can we keep?</li>
						<li>Are these temporary issues or will there be a vendor-lockin?</li>
					</ul>
